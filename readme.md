# Blog
## Intro

I've not worked with PHP in a few months so I decided to come back to it by
making a simple blogging project. The project is so much not about being a blog
but instead a project where people can write comments under a topic and then that
topic may be either down or up voted.

# Getting started
### Installing

1. Clone the repo


### Technology Stack

1. PHP 7
2. HTML 5
3. CSS3

### Operation

Once the program is downloaded, simply run the program as you would any other PHP
program.

# Issues / Other

None at this time.
